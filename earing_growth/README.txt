    In the paper "Does earnings growth drive the quality premium," the authors found that high (low) quality stocks generate anomalously high (low) returns, exceeding the expected returns based on betas, market sizes, valuations, and momentum. However, quality measures predict stock returns only when they forecast earnings growth. Based on the authors' conclusions, I constructed a factor for corporate earnings growth and attempted to analyze its relationship with stock returns.
    Following the methodology outlined in the paper, I calculated (Earningst – Earningst-r) / Bet-r as the corporate earnings factor, where earnings growth is calculated as earnings minus past earnings, and Be represents past book equity. Additionally, to test the factor's sensitivity to time periods, I constructed factors for r equal to both 1 year and 1 month. Furthermore, I created a factor for (Earningst – Earningst-r) / Bet to assess its effectiveness.
    The test results indicate that this factor performs well in the A-share market. For detail data, please refer to the output file.
